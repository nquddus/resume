    Designed the content moderation service API and infrastructure from the initial requirements and remained key developer past product launch.
      \item Developed the moderation service and supported its expansion across 7 global regions, serving up to 120 transactions per second. The service detects
    toxicity, profanity, personally identifiable information, bias, malicious intent, privacy violations, or copyrighted material in user inputs and Bedrock LLM continuations.
      \item Implemented a pipeline to build and deploy ML model binaries and accompanying inference to Sagemaker endpoints to minimize deployment time of new versions of each model.
      \item Key developer in the Memorization Suppression project to detect and suppress copyrighted and sensitive material from LLM generations. 
    Designed library to parse and index data into Amazon Opensearch Service clusters at petabyte scale including operational backup and restoration.
      \item Created the dynamic configuration system of the service allowing for filter and model configuration changes across all regions and production stages in sub second time frames.
      \item As the team expanded from two to ten members, lead learning sesions for the ResponsibleAI team, scheduling and guiding efforts to educate newer members about specific projects and the technologies used.
      \item During Amazon Bedrock product launch, served as the lead for the operational readiness and application security reviews for the Content Moderation Service. 
    Ensured service was ready for production by ensuring test coverage, integration testing, canaries, dashboards, alarms and security met Amazon Tier 1 product standards.
      \item Directed the expansion of the content moderation service to Govcloud protected partition, serving as the lead and primary developer, extending the bedrock LLM to customers adhering to ITAR, FedRAMP and other regulations.
